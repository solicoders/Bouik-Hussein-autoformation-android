**What are Android API levels?**

* An API level is a number that corresponds to a specific version of the Android platform.
* It acts like a guide for developers, indicating which features and functionalities are available on that particular version.
* Each device runs on a single API level.

**Why are API levels important?**

* They determine app compatibility:
    * An app targets a specific API level, ensuring it works best on that version and similar ones.
    * You can also specify a minimum API level, indicating the oldest version your app can run on.

**Key API level settings in your app:**

* **minSdkVersion:** This is the lowest API level your app can support. 
* Targeting a broader audience? Set a lower minSdkVersion (but consider potential limitations on older devices).
* **targetSdkVersion:** This is the API level your app is designed for and leverages its features optimally.
   It's generally recommended to use the latest targetSdkVersion possible while considering user base demographics and device compatibility.

**Finding API level information:**

* You can check the API level distribution among Android devices using various resources.
* This helps you decide which API levels to target for optimal reach.

By understanding API levels, you can develop apps that work flawlessly across a wide range of Android devices, ensuring a great user experience.

SDK, which stands for Software Development Kit, is like a big toolbox for app builders. It has all the tools and instructions they need to build features into their apps. But here's the catch:

* The toolbox (SDK) needs to match the kind of building blocks your phone has (API level). 
* If the toolbox has tools that only work with fancy new blocks (high API level) and your phone only has older blocks (low API level), then the builder can't use those fancy tools on your phone.

Here's how it connects to API levels:

1. **API level sets the stage:** It tells the app builder what kind of blocks (features) are available on your phone.
2. **SDK provides the tools:** Based on the API level, the builder chooses the right tools (parts of the SDK) to add features to their app. 
3. **Matching them up is key:** If the SDK uses tools that only work with higher-level blocks (newer features), the app might not work on your phone (with older blocks). 

So, API levels set the limits for what features an app can use, and the SDK provides the tools to build those features, but only if they match the kind of blocks your phone has!
