## Android API levels

**What are Android API levels?**

* An API level is a number that corresponds to a specific version of the Android platform.
* It acts like a guide for developers, indicating which features and functionalities are available on that particular version.
* Each device runs on a single API level.

**Why are API levels important?**

* They determine app compatibility:
    * An app targets a specific API level, ensuring it works best on that version and similar ones.
    * You can also specify a minimum API level, indicating the oldest version your app can run on.

**Key API level settings in your app:**

* **minSdkVersion:** This is the lowest API level your app can support. 
* Targeting a broader audience? Set a lower minSdkVersion (but consider potential limitations on older devices).
* **targetSdkVersion:** This is the API level your app is designed for and leverages its features optimally.
   It's generally recommended to use the latest targetSdkVersion possible while considering user base demographics and device compatibility.

**Finding API level information:**

* You can check the API level distribution among Android devices using various resources.
* This helps you decide which API levels to target for optimal reach.

By understanding API levels, you can develop apps that work flawlessly across a wide range of Android devices, ensuring a great user experience.
